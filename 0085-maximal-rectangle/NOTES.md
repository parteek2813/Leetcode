The approach used here is first row is sent as it is for calculating the area of first row.
From second row onwards , if at any element 0 occurs then make that array element 0 in sending array and otherwise all elements are incremented by their [original value +1]
​
​
Hence find these values in these ways and keep the record of maxArea seen so far and update accoridingly.
